This is just a warning to anyone interested in trying this version of this
module out.

This is pre-alpha code. If it works for you, it's a mistake. If it deletes
all your data and all your backups and all your boss' data and backups, don't
come crying to me.

Failure to read this file is not an excuse.

At some point in the future, this will become a stable(-ish) release,
compatible with Drupal 6.

If you want to try it out anyway, you're welcome to do so. If you find
anything that needs fixing, let me know. I may or may not already know about
it, and I may or may not have gotten to that part of the code, but the help
is appreciated.
